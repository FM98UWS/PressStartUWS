Apparently >25mb is too big
Looks like we'll possibly need to look into LFS if we want to keep zipping the project and uploading it here

Anyway here's a list of changes as of today

Since last backup:
 - Basic Ghost enemy
- Pixel Perfect camera (URP from latest Unity Version)
- Material with pixel snapping enabled on ALL tilemaps
- Title screen with music, button to load first area and animations
- Directional level loading and player repositioning based on where they entered from
